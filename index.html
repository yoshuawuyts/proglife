      <h2>For 12 months, starting May 1st 2015 I will be releasing:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 module a week</li>

      <h1>the process</h1>
      Knowledge is a dish best shared with others. That's why every step in the
      process will be documented so that my knowledge is less susceptible to the bus
      factor.
      <ul>
        <li>live coding streams on twitch.tv</li>
        <li>link, tricks and modules consolidatd in `knowledge`</li>
        <li>1 module a week</li>
        <li>1 website a month</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h1>the topics</h1>
      <p>
        Though I've had my fair share of backend engineering, my heart lies with the
        browser. Modern browsers are capable of so much more than rendering boring square
        layouts. I want to explore these new technologies and help shape the way in
        which we use them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>WebGL</li>
        <li>WebRTC</li>
        <li>data visualization</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>the websites</h1>
      Iteration is the key to success, and deadlines force narrowing scope. That's why
      each website will only have {28,30,31} days to be built before moving on to the
      next site.
      <ul>
        <li>May: year of code</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>the articles</h1>
      While `knowledge` is good reference material, sometimes subjects need a bit more
      padding to get started with. For that reason I'll be writing a series of articles
      that serve as a more sharable version of `knowledge`.
      <ul>
        <li>May: node native application tools</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>the modules</h1>
      Writing articles and building websites is fun, but what good is it if it isn't
      modular? To keep a steady flow, we'll be publishing a module a week.
      <ul>
