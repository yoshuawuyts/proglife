The best way to learn is by doing, so starting May 2015 I will be releasing a
module a week and a website + blogpost a month. I'm very interested in data viz
and graphics programming, so that'll be my focus. Because sharing is caring,
I'll be doing [livestreams](http://www.twitch.tv/yoshuawuyts) and writing down
my findings in [knowledge](http://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge). Let's see
how far I can get in a year.
